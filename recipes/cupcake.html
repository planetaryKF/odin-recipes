    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line cups with paper liners. Sift flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, allspice, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl; set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Beat white sugar, ½ cup butter, and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add pumpkin puree and milk; stir in flour mixture until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make the frosting: Beat cream cheese and 1/4 cup butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, until incorporated. Add vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; beat until fluffy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Frost cooled cupcakes.</p></li>
